# PyPoll_with_Python - Module 3 - Challenge

## Overview of Project

PyPoll_with_Python is our first attempt to functionally use the Python scripting language to complete different objectives. Data extraction from a CSV file, data summary using Python, and writing the analysis to a separate text file were the three main objectives of this challenge. 

## Overview of Election Audit:

The purpose of this challenge was to use hypothetical voting data across three different counties to summarize and report the outcome. 

## Election-Audit Results:

* How many votes were cast in this congressional election? 
** There was a total of 369,711 votes cast in this congressional election.

* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
** Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
** Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
** Arapahoe: 67% (24,801)

* Which county had the largest number of votes?
** Denver county had the largest number of votes cast. 82.8% (306,055)

* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total each candidate received.
** Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
** Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
** Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

* Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
** Diana DeGette won this election with 272,892 votes, which is 73.8% of the total votes cast.

## Election-Audit Summary:

The Python script used to perform this audit is very general and scalable. It can be used for any size election, with any number of candidates. 

Current use cases are allowable for two levels of details, county turnout, and candidate comparison with winner calculation. With minor adjustments (additional lists and dictionaries) this script can be modified to handle greater scale and scope. Adding state(s) and other electoral races is very easily done.

I believe that electronic ballot counting provides a cost effective and safe way to count and report election results. Using simple and transparent, scripts and files elections can be reported reliably.
